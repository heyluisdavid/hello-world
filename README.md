learning how to use Github,babyyy!

Hello,world. My name is Luis and I am an Electrical Engineer that loves to workout/train and am also getting more into software development. 
Embedded systems to be more exact. I want to make things work!The IoT(Internet of Things) world really grabs my attention. So here I am, just
figuring things out as I go. I will forever be a life-long learner :)
Lets code,baby!
